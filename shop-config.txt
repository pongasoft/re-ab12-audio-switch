Summary:
***************

**A/B Test your audio!**

The pongasoft A/B 12 Audio In Switch is a 2U **FREE** utility that lets you switch between 12 audio stereo inputs using various approaches.

**3 control modes for the 12 inputs**

- in single mode, only one input is active at a time and you can switch to another with a single click (or key on your keyboard). Perfect for A/B testing!
- in multiple mode, any combination of inputs can be active at a time (similar to the Solo concept).
- in instrument mode, you control the switch as if you were playing an instrument. Perfect for quickly coming up with creative ideas or live performance.

**External control**

- 12 Gate In inputs lets you control the switch from another device
- 12 Gate Out outputs lets you control other devices from the switch (ex: a Kong device).

**A/B bank switching**

The switch is split into 2 banks of inputs which can be independently turned on or off. A convenient control also lets you instantly toggle between the 2 banks, effectively implementing another level of switching.

**Miscellaneous features**

- Each switch can be labeled independently.
- Each switch has its own volume control.
- A soften toggle helps in eliminating clicks and pops that can occur during switching.

Although designed as a utility, the switch can be used very creatively as well!

**Usage**

Check the [documentation](http://pongasoft.com/rack-extensions/AB12Switch.html "documentation") for instructions about how to use the switch.

**Example of usage**

- Have multiple versions of an audio you want to compare (ex: different mastering)? Simply connect them to A1, A2, etc... and use Single mode to instantly switch between the different versions.

- Want to gate your sound(s)? Connect only one bank, leave the other one empty and use the CV Bank input connected to a Matrix to switch between A & B (sound / no sound => gate effect).

- Looking for inspiration? Connect any number of loops (DrRex, Audio tracks, etc...) to the switch and use Instrument mode to "play" portions of a loop with your hardware keyboard. This would be equivalent to muting portions of a waveform, except it is way easier to do and dynamic: no need to edit the sequencer track.

- Easily toggle between various samples in a live environment using the Single mode keyboard switching capability.
